  <h2>About Dirk</h2>
<p id="tribute-info">This is a tribute page for Dirk Bogarde. He was born Derek Niven van den Bogaerde, and lived from 28 March 1921 to 8 May 1999. In her obituary published in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/may/10/features">The Guardian</a>, Margaret Hinxman writes:<br>

<p>“At his peak and with directors he trusted - Joseph Losey, Luchino Visconti and Alain Resnais - Dirk Bogarde, who has died of a heart attack at 78, was probably the finest, most complete, actor on the screen. He esteemed and learned from Spencer Tracy and, in common with all the most mesmerising screen actors, could convey a quality of stillness which suggested hidden turmoil and torment. […] Victim (1961) changed his career. It was the first British film to deal openly with homosexuality and he was always proud of making it. Although it might now seem tame, at the time it was instrumental in changing the legislation against gays. It also changed the public perception of Bogarde. Doctor fans deserted him. At that time, young, working-class actors were about to conquer the British cinema and Bogarde's elegant, middle-class image seemed out of date. […] Although the Oscars and Booker prizes eluded him, many feel these omissions gave Bogarde the kind of exclusivity he would have relished. Not one of a kind, but one on his own.”</p>
<p>For most of his life, Bogarde shared his homes with Anthony Forward.</p>
